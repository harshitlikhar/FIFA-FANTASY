Project Summary 

Using a dataset from Kaggle containing records for each player and their attributes in the Fifa Video Game during the 2019-2022 Version, our database application will provide an interactive attribute summary aimed at FIFA enthusiasts who are interested and can use data to learn about historical comparisons of players and to create their own competitive team. The data also allows multiple comparisons for the same players across the last 3 versions of the videogame.
 
Project Description

Objectives:
- The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly website for the users to retrieve statistics of the different players or different variants of players - across the FIFA platform for the analysis and create their own competitive team and compare with others.
- To allow users to have a seamless experience when looking at all their FIFA players of interest.
- FIFA being a major attraction for todayâ€™s youth, our main aim towards taking this dataset was to ensure that our fellow classmates, TAs, and professors enjoy - -  - reading through it and compare players on multiple parameters in the last 8 versions of the videogame.
- Give users the accessibility to see all the existing FIFA players and give them reviews/recommendations/features all in one place
- At the end of this project, we plan on learning how to interact with data: the basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations and visualizing the results.
